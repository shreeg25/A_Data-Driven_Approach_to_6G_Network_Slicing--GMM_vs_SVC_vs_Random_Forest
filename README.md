  <h1>Zero-Touch 6G Network Slicing: Rigorous Comparative Analysis of Unsupervised GMM and Supervised Learning for Day-0 Autonomous Deployment</h1>
  <p1>The Cold-Start Problem in 6G Zero-Touch Service Management (ZSM)—unavailability of pre-labeled training data during Day-0 network initialization—remains fundamentally unaddressed in literature. This paper presents a mathematically rigorous comparative analysis between Unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Supervised learning approaches (SVC, Random Forest) for autonomous network slice assignment (eMBB, uRLLC, mMTC). Using the IEEE 5G-NIDD dataset (1,776,891 flows), we introduce a physics-informed Burstiness metric (Bi = σR,w /μR,w ) characterizing flow-level rate variance. Comprehensive experimental validation demonstrates: (1) GMM achieves 98.58% accuracy without any labeled data, diverging only 0.91 percentage points from SVC (99.49%); (2) GMM converges in 6 EM iterations (0.42 seconds), offering 5.5× speedup over SVC; (3) Actual QoS metrics (throughput 216.62 Mbps, latency 1.79 ms, loss 0.126%) are identical across all classifiers; (4) Confusion matrix analysis reveals uRLLC classification near-perfect (99.88% recall) while identifying eMBB-mMTC boundary as challenging. We establish the Hybrid Lifecycle Strategy: deploying GMM for autonomous Day-0 initialization, seamlessly transitioning to SVC as labeled data becomes available. This approach eliminates the data-labeling bottleneck while achieving near-optimal accuracy. Our findings validate that unsupervised learning is not merely a fallback but a strategic enabler of truly autonomous 6G networks.</p1>
